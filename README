I started this project in order to be able to manage patch emails. I did not
want to have to manage them manually but rather wanted it to be as much
automated as it could be. Thus started this project.

What it is intended to do is - POP emails, check for PATCH mails, make a chain
out of the patches (currently depending on REFERENCES header added by git's
send-email), find the spring point of the series, make a new branch amend the
patches and send the maintainer a summary report notifying about the amends.
Maintainer then should be able to send emails to the patch manager notifying it
to rename, merge, delete, push them. Plus the manager will have feature of
deleting a branch that the maintainer never worked on after its inception for a
specified time period.

We are open to suggestions and feature requests. The project is licensed under
GPL v3.
